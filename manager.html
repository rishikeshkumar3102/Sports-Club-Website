        Erik ten Hag s a Dutch professional football manager and former player
        who is the manager of Premier League club Manchester United. Ten Hag
        played as a centre-back and began his career with Eredivisie club
        Twente. He joined De Graafschap in 1990, and won the Eerste Divisie in
        his first season. He rejoined Twente in 1992 and transferred to RKC
        Waalwijk two years later, where he remained for one season before
        signing with Utrecht in 1995. Ten Hag returned to Twente for a third
        time in 1996, where he won KNVB Cup in 2001. He retired in 2002, at age
        32. Ten Hag began his managerial career in 2012, when he was appointed
        by Go Ahead Eagles, where he led the club to promotion to the Eredivisie
        in his debut season. He then joined Bayern Munich II in 2013, winning
        promotion to the Regionalliga Bayern in 2014. He returned to the
        Netherlands in 2015 as sporting director and head coach at Utrecht. He
        joined Ajax in 2017, where he won three Eredivisie titles, two KNVB
        Cups, and led the team to the semi-finals of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions
        League.On 21 April 2022, Ten Hag was appointed as manager of Manchester
        United starting from the end of the 2021–22 season until June 2025, with
        the option of extending for a further year.[18] Mitchell van der Gaag
        and Steve McClaren were later revealed to be joining Ten Hag as part of
        his coaching staff.[19] On 16 May, it was confirmed that Ten Hag had
        left his Ajax role early to begin his preparations as Manchester United
        manager for the 2022–23 season.[20] Ten Hag lost his first Premier
        League match, 2–1 at home to Brighton & Hove Albion on 7 August.[21]
        Following a 4–0 defeat away to Brentford on 13 August in his second
        Premier League match,[22] Ten Hag became the first Manchester United
        manager since John Chapman in 1921 to lose his first two games in
        charge.[23] On 22 August, Ten Hag won his first competitive game as
        Manchester United manager when his side recorded a 2–1 victory against
        arch-rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford. This was United's first league
        win against Liverpool since March 2018.[24] On 11 January 2023, Ten Hag
        led Manchester United to a 3–0 win over Charlton Athletic in the EFL
        Cup,[25] and in doing so became the fastest Manchester United manager to
        reach 20 competitive wins, achieving the feat in 27 games.[26] On 26
        February, Ten Hag's side beat Newcastle United 2–0 to win the EFL Cup,
        claiming their first trophy since 2017.[27] However, in their first
        league game after lifting the trophy, Ten Hag's side lost a record 7–0
        at Anfield, home of their rivals Liverpool. It was the heaviest defeat
        in the history of that fixture, as well as United's joint-heaviest
        defeat ever, and the first time they had conceded seven goals since
        1931.[28] In his first season at the club Ten Hag also led Manchester
        United to a place in the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, by finishing
        third place in the top four of the Premier League, and also got to the
        2023 FA Cup final, eventually losing to local rivals Manchester City,
        with a scoreline of 2–1.

        In 2012, Ten Hag was appointed as manager of Go Ahead Eagles in the Eerste Divisie by Marc Overmars, who was a shareholder of the club.[1][5] During his only season at Go Ahead Eagles, he led the team to its first promotion in 17 years.[citation needed]
He coached Bayern Munich II from 6 June 2013, until 2015, when he was replaced by Heiko Vogel.[6][7] During his time as manager Ten Hag led his team to the Regionalliga Bayern.[8]

Ten Hag then became the sporting director and head coach of Utrecht in summer 2015, where he led the club to fifth place during his first season.[9] In the 2016–17 season, he improved FC Utrecht's final position to fourth, booking a place in the UEFA Europa League qualifiers.

        Ten Hag played primarily as a centre-back for Twente, De Graafschap, RKC Waalwijk and Utrecht. He had three stints with Twente, with whom he won the KNVB Cup in the 2000–01 season.[citation needed]

Ten Hag also won the Eerste Divisie with De Graafschap in the 1990–91 season, ten years before winning the cup with Twente. He retired from active playing in 2002 at the age of 32 while playing for Twente, after the end of the 2001–02 Eredivisie season.
